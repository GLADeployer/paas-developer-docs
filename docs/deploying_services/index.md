Your application probably relies on backing services such as a database, an email delivery service or a monitoring system.

In Cloud Foundry, backing services are referred to as 'services' and are available through the Cloud Foundry ``marketplace`` command.

Currently, the only service available is the PostgreSQL database. 

We are going to add more services in future, including Elasticsearch and Redis.
